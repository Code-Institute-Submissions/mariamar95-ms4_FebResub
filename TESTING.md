## Automated Testing
In this project their are 3 instances of automated testing. I would like to note that if given more time i would have liked to have expanded on this, however the deadline was extremely tight.
The apps that i have tested are:
  - Home Page
   ![](documentation/test-home.png)
  - Bag
   ![](documentation/test-bag.png)
  - Products
   ![](documentation/test-products.png)
These tests are all in a separate file called test_views.py within the relevant app folders, and have been written using Python.

## Bugs
### Solved
  - #### Stipe Webhook Response Error 
    ![stripe-response error](documentation/stripe-1.png)
    After successfully placing an order, I was getting a 404 response on stripe which meant that the endpoint webhook wasn't found. I found out that it was caused by Gitpod changing the server number of my workspace from eu-80 to eu-81. I updated the endpoint on Stripe and placed another order to test it.
    ![stripe-response error](documentation/stripe-2.png)
    After updating the endpoint I was getting a 400 error. I added some print statements on the webhook file will which raised the following error:
    ![stripe-response error](documentation/stripe-3.png)
    Stripe's Webhook Secret Key wasn't coming through which was causing the problem. That was happening because when I added the Webhook Secret on Heroku's Vars I forgot to added on my env file. When I added the Webhook Secret on the env file I also found that I forgot to add 'DEVELOPMENT' on that file as well. After updating both I placed another order to test it and checked on stipe's webhook logs.
    ![stripe-response error](documentation/stripe-4.png)
    I was getting a 200-OK Response. I committed the changes and tested the deployed app on Heroku as well. After placing an order on the deployed app, I was getting and error again which was caused by a missing trailing slash in the endpoint.
     ![stripe-response error](documentation/stripe-5.png)
    I edited the endpoint on stripe, placed and other order and tested it again.

    To resolve the issue I have taken the following steps:
    - I checked that the bucket policy had public access.
    - I checked the bucket policy code written in JSON for syntax mistakes.
    - I checked that the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key from where correctly added on Heroku's Config Vars.

    When checking the AWS Access Key ID I noticed that there was a '/' in it which can be problematic. I tried generating a new Access Key ID from AWS and updating it on Heroku's Config Vars which solved the issue.

  - #### Connecting Django to AWS
    ![AWS](documentation/aws-bug.png)

    I deployed the app on Heroku but without the static files. I created a S3 Bucket on AWS to store the static files and linked that to my app. After linking AWS to my app and trying to redeploy on Heroku I was getting the following error:
    
    ```
     botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation: Access Denied
     Error while running '$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput'. 
    ```

    To resolve the issue I have taken the following steps:
      - I checked that the bucket policy had public access.
      - I checked the bucket policy code written in JSON for syntax mistakes.
      - I checked that the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key from where correctly added on Heroku's Config Vars.

    When checking the AWS Access Key ID I noticed that there was a '/' in it which can be problematic. I tried generating a new Access Key ID from AWS and updating it on Heroku's Config Vars which solved the issue.

  - #### The jQuery was not working for the toasts
 I researched this issue on slack and it seemed to be a known error with the toasts and bootstrap 5. As I was on a very tight deadline for this project and could not find a solution over an afternoon, despite bootstrap 5 being compatible for use with jQuery, I have decided to revert the bootstrap version used in the project down to 4.4.1. This also meant that I had to update some of the css

### Known Bugs
- #### County Input Field
- Both on Profile and Checkout Page, the country input field is longer that the rest of the input fields. I wanted to customise the input forms and add some space around the input fields but I run out of time.
